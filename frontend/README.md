### Configuration in keycloak

In Keycloak we need to create a realm and import the client nammed `snowlifttracker-client` which contains the good configuration.
However, each time you launch keycloak, you need to re-create a realm, re-upload the client and reconfigure the two roles "admin" and "user".
You will also need to create users who will be assigned one of the two roles

**To create the snowlifttracker-realm :**

    -   Click on "Administration Console"
    -   username : "admin"
    -   password : "admin"
    -   Click on "Manage" (in the 'â˜°' symbol)
    -   Click on "Create Realm"
    -   In "Realm name" write "snowlifttracker-realm"
    -   Create

**To import the snowlifttracker-client :**

    -   Select the "Snowlifttracker-realm" you have created
    -   Click on "Client"
    -   Click on "Import Client"
    -   Import the file "snowlifttracker-frontend.json"
    -   Save

**To create the two roles "admin" and "user"**

    -   In the "snowlifttracker-frontend" client
    -   Click on "Roles" tab
    -   Click on "Create Role"
    -   In "Role name" write "admin" and save
    -   Do the same operation for "user"


**To create user and assign them to a role**

    -   Click on the 'â˜°' symbol and go to Users
    -   Click on "Create user"
    -   Fill every blanks
    -   Don't select any action and Create
    -   To assign a password go to "Credentials" tab
    -  Click on "Set password"
    -   Set a password and Put "Temporary" at off
    -   To assign the role to the user go to "Role mapping"
    -   Click on "assign role"
    -   "Filter by client"
    -   select "snowlifttracker-frontend admin" or "snowlifttracker-frontend user" (you may need to switch to the next list tab because there is 29 roles).
